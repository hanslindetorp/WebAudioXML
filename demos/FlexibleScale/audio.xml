	<!-- This variable 'pitch' reads the global variable 'relX' (the current position of the pointer on the touch are) which 
		is a value between 0 and 100 (%). It is mapped to a value between 60 and 72. These values are typical MIDI note values
		that will be snapped to steps. The 'steps' attribute is an array of values indicating the scale pattern used for snapping
		the value to a pattern of integers between 60 and 72. The pattern refers to the variable '$up' which increases those step
		values when the pointer is moving to the right.
		Finally the value is converted from the range of MIDI notes (60-72) to the range of frequencies for those pitches. -->
