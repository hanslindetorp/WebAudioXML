<!-- 
All loops are controlled by imusic (https://github.com/hanslindetorp/imusic) and are specified in the file "music.xml"
Their output is set to different "inputs" in WebAudioXML controlled by the id-attribute in the nodes below. The output of each node is summed in the mixer.
The range of the slider is specified in "index.html" and is set to 0 - 100.

<!-- 
The pad is routed through a "chain" that acts similar to a channel strip in a mixing console. This setup lets the
slider control both the gain level and the cutoff frequency for the high-pass filter. The mapping makes the pad 
play at full volume from start and fade out when the slider moves towards 60. The Highpass-filer lower the 
cutoff frequency and the Q-value when the slider moves from 0 to 10.

"chain"-element. The filter and finally a compresseor act as insert-effects on a master bus in a mixing console.
