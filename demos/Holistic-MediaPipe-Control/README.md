        <p>AudioPipe is an implementation of <a href="https://google.github.io/mediapipe/">MediaPipe</a> for 
        <a href="https://github.com/hanslindetorp/WebAudioXML">WebAudioXML</a>. I was inspired by the great idea from 
        <a href="https://github.com/monlim/Handmate-MIDI">Handmate-MIDI</a> to control
        audio data with the fantastic MediaPipe library. AudioPipe is an online, fully programmable,
      gesture controlled musical instrument. You can play with the presets or edit the code and make your own sound
      synthesis and mappings. Please read the documentation for WebAudioXML to take advantage of all the possibilities.

        mapped to any audio parameter using the &lt;var&gt;-element. Please not that all variable names shall be prefixed 
        with a dollar sign. The naming convention for the variables follow the 
        following scheme:
