Handmate-MIDI - we recommend using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge as web MIDI is not supported by many other browsers. This version has been developed for desktop only. Windows users need to use loopMidi or VBAN-2-Midi as a bridge (driver) for the MIDI out device. Please make sure you have enabled MIDI in your browser security settings.
